    "## Different levels of theory\n",
    "There are four MoleculeNet folders, each with different data computed with different methods. They are:\n",
    "1. `molecule_net`\n",
    "    - This is the folder with CREST conformer ensembles computed in **vacuum**. It has data for over 97% of species in ESOL, FreeSolv, Lipophilicity, BACE, BBBP, Tox21, ToxCast, SIDER, and ClinTox.\n",
    "    - Note that some of the molecules in MoleculeNet are also in GEOM-Drugs. All repeats can be found in either folder.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `bace_water`\n",
    "    - This folder has CREST conformer ensembles computed in **water** for the BACE dataset. The solvent was treated with the ALPB model.\n",
    "    - 1,511 of the 1,513 BACE species are available (99.9%).\n",
    "    - In addition to the normal CREST/xTB data, each species also has single-point DFT calculations **in water** for most of its CREST conformers.\n",
    "        - These calculations were performed with the r2scan-3c functional, using the mtzvpp basis, with a PCM description of water\n",
    "        - The DFT information for each conformer is a value in the conformer dictionary, with the key \"r2scan_3c_mtzvpp\" (more on that below).\n",
    "        - The conformers that do or don't have r2scan calculations can be confusing\n",
    "            - In short, every species should have single-point r2scan calculations for all conformers with non-negligible statistical weight. In particular:\n",
    "                - Not every CREST conformer in the BACE dataset has a single point r2scan calculation. In fact, for a given CENSO job, about 73% of conformers were removed after a b973c calculation. This was because their b97 free energies were higher than the CENSO threshold of 4.0 kcal/mol\n",
    "                - Some CREST conformers with free energies *much higher* than 4.0 kcal/mol may also be present. Because for about 20% of the species, we did single point calculations on all geometries, rather than  rather than first doing b973c and then selecting those below a threshold. We did not do CENSO on these species because it would have been too expensive\n",
    "        \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. `censo`\n",
    "    - This folder has CENSO conformer ensembles computed in **water** for the BACE dataset. The solvent was treated with the PCM model; more details of the calculation can be found in the GEOM paper.\n",
    "    - 534 of the 1,513 BACE species are available \n",
    "    - The data in each pickle file is organized just like all the others. One thing of note is that each conformer has a value for `confnum` assigned to it. \n",
    "        - This is the number of the original CREST conformer that was optimized, and led to the current CENSO conformer. \n",
    "        - The numbers are ordered from highest CREST Boltzmann weight to lowest, and start at 1.\n",
    "        - The original CREST conformer can therefore be found in the `bace_water` folder by matching up its value of `confnum` to that of the CENSO conformer. This can be useful for seeing how much the DFT optimization changed each geometry.\n",
    "        \n",
    "   \n",
    "4. `censo_hess_and_orbs`\n",
    "    - The final CENSO geometries have Hessians for computing the free energy contribution to the statistical weight. These were computed with the [\"single-point Hessian\" method](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c01306?casa_token=1FkQuhnvzbkAAAAA:FHOXbVkt1ZICCzdgmFbxaK3tbLUNcSUwIj2QXlPVPLivWdxHguUgHdeijb5VYmqg2rLEww1b5U8Mzm0), and so is an *approximation* to the exact r2scan-3c Hessian.\n",
    "    - Because the Hessians are quite large, we have separated them from the pickle files in `censo` and put them in their own folder, `censo_hess_and_orbs`. We have also put the orbital energies in this folder.\n",
    "    - Each pickle file is a dictionary, where the keys are conformer IDs and the values are Hessian and orbital information. They can be matched to the `censo` conformers by finding the matching `geom_id` key (more on that below).\n",

For this reason, the absolute energies are much closer to those of xTB than r2scan. \n",

To displace atoms along mode $j$, you would move them in the direction `vibdisps[j]`.
